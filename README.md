# To-Do-List ðŸ“‹
Built a to-do list web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a clean and minimal user interface.
Users can:
- Add new tasks by clicking on "Add" button or pressing Enter
- Mark tasks as completed using a checkbox
-	Delete tasks once completed or if added by mistake

I've also implemented localStorage to ensure the task list (including completed or unchecked tasks) remains intact even after reloading or closing the browser tab.

ðŸ•“ Upcoming Features:
-	Edit task name
-	Task completion status (Completed/Total) with progress bar
-	Responsive desgin
